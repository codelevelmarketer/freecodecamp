          <h2>Let's learn a bit about this fascinating human</h2>

          <p>
            Henry David Thoreau (see name pronunciation; July 12, 1817 – May 6,
            1862) was an American naturalist, essayist, poet, and philosopher. A
            leading transcendentalist, he is best known for his book Walden, a
            reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay
            "Civil Disobedience" (originally published as "Resistance to Civil
            Government"), an argument for disobedience to an unjust state.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry amount to
            more than 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his
            writings on natural history and philosophy, in which he anticipated
            the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two
            sources of modern-day environmentalism. His literary style
            interweaves close observation of nature, personal experience,
            pointed rhetoric, symbolic meanings, and historical lore, while
            displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical austerity, and
            attention to practical detail. He was also deeply interested in the
            idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change,
            and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste
            and illusion in order to discover life's true essential needs.

            Thoreau was a lifelong abolitionist, delivering lectures that
            attacked the Fugitive Slave Law while praising the writings of
            Wendell Phillips and defending the abolitionist John Brown.
            Thoreau's philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the
            political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as Leo
            Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr.

            Thoreau is sometimes referred to as an anarchist. In "Civil
            Disobedience", Thoreau wrote: "I heartily accept the motto, — 'That
            government is best which governs least;' and I should like to see it
            acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally
            amounts to this, which also I believe, — 'That government is best
            which governs not at all;' and when men are prepared for it, that
            will be the kind of government which they will have. [...] I ask
            for, not at once no government, but at once a better government."
